# UConnect â€“ SENG 401 Final Project

**UConnect** is a full-stack web application developed as the final project for **SENG 401: Software Architecture** at the University of Calgary the project demonstrates principles of scalable software design, component-based architecture, and effective team collaboration. UConnect is designed to simulate a unified communication system with clearly separated frontend and backend layers.

It was created by a team of **7 students** with the intention of promoting a closely knitted community at the University of Calgary by easily creating events for campus students to join.

## ðŸš€ Running the Application

Below are instructions to run the applications (frontend and backend) SEPARATELY and TOGETHER!

First, make sure you `cd uconnect`, then run whatever is needed! :)

### To Run them SEPARATELY:

**Running the Frontend:** `npm start`

**Running the Backend:** `npm run start-server`

**_Run these in separate terminals!_**

### To Run them TOGETHER:

**Running BOTH Frontend and Backend:** `npm run dev`

If the command above gives errors, `cd` to the `uconnect` directory, run `npm install --save-dev concurrently`, and try again :)
